= Fortran 90/UMFPACK Sparse Matrix Solver Example =

This program demonstrates how to solve a sparse, square matrix using the UMFPACK library in a Fortran 90 program.

This example is intended as a starting point for people who want to use UMFPACK with Fortran 90. It covers the basics of creating a sparse format matrix, solving the equation Ax = b, and compiling/linking against UMFPACK.

== Quickstart

=== Dependancies 

To get started, you will need to install UMFPACK. On Ubuntu based systems these are provided by the following packages

    apt-get install suitesparse libsuitesparse-dev

=== Compile

    gfortran umf4_f77wrapper.c sparse.F90 -lumfpack -o sparse

=== Run

    $ ./sparse 
    1.45519152283668518E-011
    1.45519152283668518E-011
